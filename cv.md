### About Myself:

Two years ago I decided to change my profession. To start my journey in IT, I chose front-end development courses at the on-line school of "GOIT". I studied markup, Java Script, React-js, Node-js. It was a deep dive in every direction.


I am interested in web development because this profession provides opportunities for professional growth, meeting interesting people and working remotely.


I did an internship at a startup as a react developer, and also made a website to order. Now I am doing an internship at another startup, where I consolidate my knowledge and learn how to work in a team.


I like to improve my skills, in my free time I solve "Codewars" problems or watch YouTube videos about new development opportunities.
